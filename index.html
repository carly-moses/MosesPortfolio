                        Hi, my name is Carly and I am so excited to be a part of Grand Circus! My background is in Elementary Education and even though 
                        I am ready for a career change, I know education will always be a part of my life. 
                        I am always willing to learn and better myself, as well as help others become the best 
                        versions of themselves. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my dog, Milo, traveling as much as possible, 
                        and spending time with family and friends. I am hoping at the end of this course, I am hoping the hard work
                        will pay off and  I will be able to land a job I enjoying doing. 
                    </p>
